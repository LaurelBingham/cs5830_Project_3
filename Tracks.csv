Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this

Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay

You know it's not the same as it was

Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

I'm one of the greatest, ain't no debatin' on it (let's go)
I'm still levitatin', I'm heavily medicated
Ironic, I gave 'em love, and they end up hatin' on me (cold)
She told me she love me, and she'd been waitin'
Been fightin' hard for your love, and I'm runnin' thin on my patience
Needed someone to hug, even took it back to the basics

You see what you got me out here doin'? (Yeah)
Might've threw me off, but can't nobody stop the movement, uh-uh

All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact, I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boy

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?

Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring

My mind feels like a foreign land

Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me, too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus

We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside

Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'

I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit

It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers

Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug

As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes
Don't let these hoes bother me

Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Oh-ah, oh oh, oh

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my-
But my heart don't understand

From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here

In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

Maybe one day, you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Now, walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honky""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (piss)
But shit, it was 99 cents (bag it)

Copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins, someone else's been walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style

Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four-track, bussin'

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

You were right here all along

Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
Bunch of stereotypes all in my head

I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion

Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried, even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love

She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Heard about the news, whole day went sour

Bitter moments feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in a box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried 'bout the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace
DUI, never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh, no, I can't stop, I was destined

And do a little bit of country song, hangin' on
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Hey honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'
Oh my, my shit

I'm still looking up

To do some navigating

Blow me one last kiss

Want back my ignorance and bliss

I would be your girl

Be us against the world

I would make you stay

Mama was an angel in the ground

To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
